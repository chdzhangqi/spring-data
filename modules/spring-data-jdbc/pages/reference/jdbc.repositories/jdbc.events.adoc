== Lifecycle Events

Spring Data JDBC triggers events that get published to any matching `ApplicationListener` beans in the application context.
For example, the following listener gets invoked before an aggregate gets saved:

====
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public ApplicationListener<BeforeSave> timeStampingSaveTime() {

	return event -> {

		Object entity = event.getEntity();
		if (entity instanceof Category) {
			Category category = (Category) entity;
			category.timeStamp();
		}
	};
}
----
====

The following table describes the available events:

.Available events
|===
| Event | When It Is Published

| {javadoc-base}org/springframework/data/relational/core/mapping/event/BeforeDeleteEvent.html[`BeforeDeleteEvent`]
| Before an aggregate root gets deleted.

| {javadoc-base}org/springframework/data/relational/core/mapping/event/AfterDeleteEvent.html[`AfterDeleteEvent`]
| After an aggregate root gets deleted.

| {javadoc-base}/org/springframework/data/relational/core/mapping/event/BeforeConvertEvent.html[`BeforeConvertEvent`]
| Before an aggregate root gets saved (that is, inserted or updated but after the decision about whether if it gets updated or deleted was made).

| {javadoc-base}/org/springframework/data/relational/core/mapping/event/BeforeSaveEvent.html[`BeforeSaveEvent`]
| Before an aggregate root gets saved (that is, inserted or updated but after the decision about whether if it gets updated or deleted was made).

| {javadoc-base}org/springframework/data/relational/core/mapping/event/AfterSaveEvent.html[`AfterSaveEvent`]
| After an aggregate root gets saved (that is, inserted or updated).

| {javadoc-base}org/springframework/data/relational/core/mapping/event/AfterLoadEvent.html[`AfterLoadEvent`]
| After an aggregate root gets created from a database `ResultSet` and all its property get set.

WARNING: Lifecycle events depend on an `ApplicationEventMulticaster`, which in case of the `SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster` can be configured with a `TaskExecutor`, and therefore gives no guarantees when an Event is processed.

[[jdbc.entity-callbacks]]
=== Store-specific EntityCallbacks

Spring Data JDBC uses the `EntityCallback` API for its auditing support and reacts on the following callbacks:

.Available Callbacks
|===
| `EntityCallback` | When It Is Published

| {javadoc-base}org/springframework/data/relational/core/mapping/event/BeforeDeleteCallback.html[`BeforeDeleteCallback`]
| Before an aggregate root gets deleted.

| {javadoc-base}org/springframework/data/relational/core/mapping/event/AfterDeleteCallback.html[`AfterDeleteCallback`]
| After an aggregate root gets deleted.

| {javadoc-base}/org/springframework/data/relational/core/mapping/event/BeforeConvertCallback.html[`BeforeConvertCallback`]
