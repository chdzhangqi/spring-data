== Transactionality
CRUD methods on repository instances are transactional by default.
For reading operations, the transaction configuration `readOnly` flag is set to `true`. All others are configured with a plain `@Transactional` annotation so that default transaction configuration applies.
For details, see the Javadoc of link:{javadoc-base}org/springframework/data/jdbc/repository/support/SimpleJdbcRepository.html[`SimpleJdbcRepository`]. If you need to tweak transaction configuration for one of the methods declared in a repository, redeclare the method in your repository interface, as follows:

.Custom transaction configuration for CRUD
====
[source, java]
----
public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {

  @Override
  @Transactional(timeout = 10)
  public List<User> findAll();

  // Further query method declarations
}
----
====

The preceding causes the `findAll()` method to be executed with a timeout of 10 seconds and without the `readOnly` flag.

Another way to alter transactional behavior is by using a facade or service implementation that typically covers more than one repository. Its purpose is to define transactional boundaries for non-CRUD operations. The following example shows how to create such a facade:

.Using a facade to define transactions for multiple repository calls
====
[source, java]
----
@Service
class UserManagementImpl implements UserManagement {

  private final UserRepository userRepository;
  private final RoleRepository roleRepository;

  @Autowired
  public UserManagementImpl(UserRepository userRepository,
    RoleRepository roleRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
    this.roleRepository = roleRepository;
  }

  @Transactional
  public void addRoleToAllUsers(String roleName) {

    Role role = roleRepository.findByName(roleName);

    for (User user : userRepository.findAll()) {
      user.addRole(role);
      userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
----
====

The preceding example causes calls to `addRoleToAllUsers(â€¦)` to run inside a transaction (participating in an existing one or creating a new one if none are already running). The transaction configuration for the repositories is neglected, as the outer transaction configuration determines the actual repository to be used. Note that you have to explicitly activate `<tx:annotation-driven />` or use `@EnableTransactionManagement` to get annotation-based configuration for facades working. Note that the preceding example assumes you use component scanning.

[[jdbc.transaction.query-methods]]
=== Transactional Query Methods
To let your query methods be transactional, use `@Transactional` at the repository interface you define, as the following example shows:

.Using @Transactional at query methods
====
[source, java]
----
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {

  List<User> findByLastname(String lastname);

  @Modifying
  @Transactional
  @Query("delete from User u where u.active = false")
  void deleteInactiveUsers();
}
----
====

Typically, you want the `readOnly` flag to be set to true, because most of the query methods only read data. In contrast to that, `deleteInactiveUsers()` uses the `@Modifying` annotation and overrides the transaction configuration. Thus, the method is with the `readOnly` flag set to `false`.

NOTE: It is definitely reasonable to use transactions for read-only queries, and we can mark them as such by setting the `readOnly` flag. This does not, however, act as a check that you do not trigger a manipulating query (although some databases reject `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements inside a read-only transaction). Instead, the `readOnly` flag is propagated as a hint to the underlying JDBC driver for performance optimizations.
