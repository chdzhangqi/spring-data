== Query Methods

This section offers some specific information about the implementation and use of Spring Data JDBC.

[[jdbc.query-methods.strategies]]
=== Query Lookup Strategies

The JDBC module supports defining a query manually only as a String in a `@Query` annotation.
Deriving a query from the name of the method is currently not supported.

[[jdbc.query-methods.at-query]]
=== Using `@Query`

The following example shows how to use `@Query` to declare a query method:

.Declare a query method by using @Query
====
[source, java]
----
public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {

  @Query("select firstName, lastName from User u where u.emailAddress = :email")
  User findByEmailAddress(@Param("email") String email);
}
----
====

NOTE: Spring fully supports Java 8â€™s parameter name discovery based on the `-parameters` compiler flag. By using this flag in your build as an alternative to debug information, you can omit the `@Param` annotation for named parameters.

NOTE: Spring Data JDBC supports only named parameters.


[[jdbc.query-methods.at-query.custom-rowmapper]]
==== Custom `RowMapper`

You can configure which `RowMapper` to use, either by using the `@Query(rowMapperClass = ....)` or by registering a `RowMapperMap` bean and registering a `RowMapper` per method return type. The following example shows how to register `RowMappers`:

====
[source,java]
----
@Bean
RowMapperMap rowMappers() {
	return new ConfigurableRowMapperMap() //
		.register(Person.class, new PersonRowMapper()) //
		.register(Address.class, new AddressRowMapper());
}
----
====

When determining which `RowMapper` to use for a method, the following steps are followed, based on the return type of the method:

. If the type is a simple type, no `RowMapper` is used.
+
Instead, the query is expected to return a single row with a single column, and a conversion to the return type is applied to that value.
. The entity classes in the `RowMapperMap` are iterated until one is found that is a superclass or interface of the return type in question.
The `RowMapper` registered for that class is used.
+
Iterating happens in the order of registration, so make sure to register more general types after specific ones.

If applicable, wrapper types such as collections or `Optional` are unwrapped.
Thus, a return type of `Optional<Person>` uses the `Person` type in the preceding process.


[[jdbc.query-methods.at-query.modifying]]
==== Modifying Query

You can mark a query as being a modifying query by using the `@Modifying` on query method, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@Modifying
@Query("UPDATE DUMMYENTITY SET name = :name WHERE id = :id")
boolean updateName(@Param("id") Long id, @Param("name") String name);
----
====

You can specify the following return types:

* `void`
* `int` (updated record count)
* `boolean`(whether a record was updated)
