= JMX support

The JMX support for MongoDB exposes the results of executing the 'serverStatus' command on the admin database for a single MongoDB server instance. It also exposes an administrative MBean, `MongoAdmin`, that lets you perform administrative operations, such as dropping or creating a database. The JMX features build upon the JMX feature set available in the Spring Framework. See http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#jmx[here] for more details.
