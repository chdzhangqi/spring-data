== Lifecycle Events

The MongoDB mapping framework includes several `org.springframework.context.ApplicationEvent` events that your application can respond to by registering special beans in the `ApplicationContext`. Being based on Spring's `ApplicationContext` event infrastructure enables other products, such as Spring Integration, to easily receive these events, as they are a well known eventing mechanism in Spring-based applications.

To intercept an object before it goes through the conversion process (which turns your domain object into a `org.bson.Document`), you can register a subclass of `AbstractMongoEventListener` that overrides the `onBeforeConvert` method. When the event is dispatched, your listener is called and passed the domain object before it goes into the converter. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java]
----
public class BeforeConvertListener extends AbstractMongoEventListener<Person> {
  @Override
  public void onBeforeConvert(BeforeConvertEvent<Person> event) {
    ... does some auditing manipulation, set timestamps, whatever ...
  }
}
----

To intercept an object before it goes into the database, you can register a subclass of `org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.mapping.event.AbstractMongoEventListener` that overrides the `onBeforeSave` method. When the event is dispatched, your listener is called and passed the domain object and the converted `com.mongodb.Document`. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java]
----
public class BeforeSaveListener extends AbstractMongoEventListener<Person> {
  @Override
  public void onBeforeSave(BeforeSaveEvent<Person> event) {
    … change values, delete them, whatever …
  }
}
----
====

Declaring these beans in your Spring ApplicationContext causes them to be invoked whenever the event is dispatched.

The following callback methods are present in `AbstractMappingEventListener`:

* `onBeforeConvert`: Called in `MongoTemplate` `insert`, `insertList`, and `save` operations before the object is converted to a `Document` by a `MongoConverter`.
* `onBeforeSave`: Called in `MongoTemplate` `insert`, `insertList`, and `save` operations *before* inserting or saving the `Document` in the database.
* `onAfterSave`: Called in `MongoTemplate` `insert`, `insertList`, and `save` operations *after* inserting or saving the `Document` in the database.
* `onAfterLoad`: Called in `MongoTemplate` `find`, `findAndRemove`, `findOne`, and `getCollection` methods after the `Document` has been retrieved from the database.
* `onAfterConvert`: Called in `MongoTemplate` `find`, `findAndRemove`, `findOne`, and `getCollection` methods after the `Document` has been retrieved from the database was converted to a POJO.

NOTE: Lifecycle events are only emitted for root level types. Complex types used as properties within a document root are not subject to event publication unless they are document references annotated with `@DBRef`.
