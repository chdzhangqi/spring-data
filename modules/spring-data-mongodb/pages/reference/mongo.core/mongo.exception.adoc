== Exception Translation

The Spring framework provides exception translation for a wide variety of database and mapping technologies. This has traditionally been for JDBC and JPA. The Spring support for MongoDB extends this feature to the MongoDB Database by providing an implementation of the `org.springframework.dao.support.PersistenceExceptionTranslator` interface.

The motivation behind mapping to Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#dao-exceptions[consistent data access exception hierarchy] is that you are then able to write portable and descriptive exception handling code without resorting to coding against MongoDB error codes. All of Spring's data access exceptions are inherited from the root `DataAccessException` class so that you can be sure to catch all database related exception within a single try-catch block. Note that not all exceptions thrown by the MongoDB driver inherit from the `MongoException` class. The inner exception and message are preserved so that no information is lost.

Some of the mappings performed by the `MongoExceptionTranslator` are `com.mongodb.Network to DataAccessResourceFailureException` and `MongoException` error codes 1003, 12001, 12010, 12011, and 12012 to `InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException`. Look into the implementation for more details on the mapping.
