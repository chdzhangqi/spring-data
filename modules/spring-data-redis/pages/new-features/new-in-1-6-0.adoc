== New in Spring Data Redis 1.6

* The `Lettuce` Redis driver switched from https://github.com/wg/lettuce[wg/lettuce] to https://github.com/mp911de/lettuce[mp911de/lettuce].
* Support for `ZRANGEBYLEX`.
* Enhanced range operations for `ZSET`, including `+inf` / `-inf`.
* Performance improvements in `RedisCache`, now releasing connections earlier.
* Generic Jackson2 `RedisSerializer` making use of Jackson's polymorphic deserialization.
