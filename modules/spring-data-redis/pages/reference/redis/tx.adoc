= Redis Transactions

Redis provides support for http://redis.io/topics/transactions[transactions] through the `multi`, `exec`, and `discard` commands. These operations are available on `RedisTemplate`. However, `RedisTemplate` is not guaranteed to execute all operations in the transaction with the same connection.

Spring Data Redis provides the `SessionCallback` interface for use when multiple operations need to be performed with the same `connection`, such as when using Redis transactions. The following example uses the `multi` method:

[source,java]
----
//execute a transaction
List<Object> txResults = redisTemplate.execute(new SessionCallback<List<Object>>() {
  public List<Object> execute(RedisOperations operations) throws DataAccessException {
    operations.multi();
    operations.opsForSet().add("key", "value1");

    // This will contain the results of all operations in the transaction
    return operations.exec();
  }
});
System.out.println("Number of items added to set: " + txResults.get(0));
----

`RedisTemplate` uses its value, hash key, and hash value serializers to deserialize all results of `exec` before returning. There is an additional `exec` method that lets you pass a custom serializer for transaction results.
NOTE: As of version 1.1, an important change has been made to the `exec` methods of `RedisConnection` and `RedisTemplate`. Previously, these methods returned the results of transactions directly from the connectors. This means that the data types often differed from those returned from the methods of `RedisConnection`. For example, `zAdd` returns a boolean indicating whether the element has been added to the sorted set. Most connectors return this value as a long, and Spring Data Redis performs the conversion. Another common difference is that most connectors return a status reply (usually the string, `OK`) for operations such as `set`. These replies are typically discarded by Spring Data Redis. Prior to 1.1, these conversions were not performed on the results of `exec`. Also, results were not deserialized in `RedisTemplate`, so they often included raw byte arrays. If this change breaks your application, set `convertPipelineAndTxResults` to `false` on your `RedisConnectionFactory` to disable this behavior.

== @Transactional Support

By default, transaction Support is disabled and has to be explicitly enabled for each `RedisTemplate` in use by setting `setEnableTransactionSupport(true)`. Doing so forces binding the current `RedisConnection` to the current `Thread` that is triggering `MULTI`. If the transaction finishes without errors, `EXEC` is called. Otherwise `DISCARD` is called. Once in `MULTI`, `RedisConnection` queues write operations. All `readonly` operations, such as `KEYS`, are piped to a fresh (non-thread-bound) `RedisConnection`.

The following example shows how to configure transaction management:

.Configuration enabling Transaction Management
====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableTransactionManagement                                 <1>
public class RedisTxContextConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public StringRedisTemplate redisTemplate() {
    StringRedisTemplate template = new StringRedisTemplate(redisConnectionFactory());
    // explicitly enable transaction support
    template.setEnableTransactionSupport(true);              <2>
    return template;
  }

  @Bean
  public RedisConnectionFactory redisConnectionFactory() {
    // jedis || Lettuce
  }

  @Bean
  public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager() throws SQLException {
    return new DataSourceTransactionManager(dataSource());   <3>
  }

  @Bean
  public DataSource dataSource() throws SQLException {
    // ...
  }
}
----
<1> Configures a Spring Context to enable http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#transaction-declarative[declarative transaction management].
<2> Configures `RedisTemplate` to participate in transactions by binding connections to the current thread.
<3> Transaction management requires a `PlatformTransactionManager`. Spring Data Redis does not ship with a `PlatformTransactionManager` implementation. Assuming your application uses JDBC, Spring Data Redis can participate in transactions by using existing transaction managers.

The following examples each demonstrate a usage constraint:

.Usage Constraints
====
[source,java]
----
// must be performed on thread-bound connection
template.opsForValue().set("thing1", "thing2");

// read operation must be executed on a free (not transaction-aware) connection
template.keys("*");

// returns null as values set within a transaction are not visible
template.opsForValue().get("thing1");
