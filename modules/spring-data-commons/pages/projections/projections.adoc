= Projections

Spring Data query methods usually return one or multiple instances of the aggregate root managed by the repository.
However, it might sometimes be desirable to create projections based on certain attributes of those types.
Spring Data allows modeling dedicated return types, to more selectively retrieve partial views of the managed aggregates.

Imagine a repository and aggregate root type such as the following example:

.A sample aggregate and repository
====
[source, java]
----
class Person {

  @Id UUID id;
  String firstname, lastname;
  Address address;

  static class Address {
    String zipCode, city, street;
  }
}

interface PersonRepository extends Repository<Person, UUID> {

  Collection<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);
}
----
====

Now imagine that we want to retrieve the person's name attributes only.
What means does Spring Data offer to achieve this? The rest of this chapter answers that question.
