== Dynamic Projections

So far, we have used the projection type as the return type or element type of a collection.
However, you might want to select the type to be used at invocation time (which makes it dynamic).
To apply dynamic projections, use a query method such as the one shown in the following example:

.A repository using a dynamic projection parameter
====
[source, java]
----
interface PersonRepository extends Repository<Person, UUID> {

  <T> Collection<T> findByLastname(String lastname, Class<T> type);
}
----
====

This way, the method can be used to obtain the aggregates as is or with a projection applied, as shown in the following example:

.Using a repository with dynamic projections
====
[source, java]
----
void someMethod(PersonRepository people) {

  Collection<Person> aggregates =
    people.findByLastname("Matthews", Person.class);

  Collection<NamesOnly> aggregates =
    people.findByLastname("Matthews", NamesOnly.class);
}
----
