= Object Mapping Fundamentals

This section covers the fundamentals of Spring Data object mapping, object creation, field and property access, mutability and immutability.
Note, that this section only applies to Spring Data modules that do not use the object mapping of the underlying data store (like JPA).
Also be sure to consult the store-specific sections for store-specific object mapping, like indexes, customizing column or field names or the like.

Core responsibility of the Spring Data object mapping is to create instances of domain objects and map the store-native data structures onto those.
This means we need two fundamental steps:

1. Instance creation by using one of the constructors exposed.
2. Instance population to materialize all exposed properties.
