== General recommendations

* _Try to stick to immutable objects_ -- Immutable objects are straightforward to create as materializing an object is then a matter of calling its constructor only.
Also, this avoids your domain objects to be littered with setter methods that allow client code to manipulate the objects state.
If you need those, prefer to make them package protected so that they can only be invoked by a limited amount of co-located types.
Constructor-only materialization is up to 30% faster than properties population.
* _Provide an all-args constructor_ -- Even if you cannot or don't want to model your entities as immutable values, there's still value in providing a constructor that takes all properties of the entity as arguments, including the mutable ones, as this allows the object mapping to skip the property population for optimal performance.
* _Use factory methods instead of overloaded constructors to avoid ``@PersistenceConstructor``_ -- With an all-argument constructor needed for optimal performance, we usually want to expose more application use case specific constructors that omit things like auto-generated identifiers etc.
It's an established pattern to rather use static factory methods to expose these variants of the all-args constructor.
* _Make sure you adhere to the constraints that allow the generated instantiator and property accessor classes to be used_ --
* _For identifiers to be generated, still use a final field in combination with a wither method_ --
* _Use Lombok to avoid boilerplate code_ -- As persistence operations usually require a constructor taking all arguments, their declaration becomes a tedious repetition of boilerplate parameter to field assignments that can best be avoided by using Lombok's `@AllArgsConstructor`.
