== Auditing

[qanda]
I want to use Spring Data JPA auditing capabilities but have my database already configured to set modification and creation date on entities. How can I prevent Spring Data from setting the date programmatically. :: Set the `set-dates` attribute of the `auditing` namespace element to `false`.
